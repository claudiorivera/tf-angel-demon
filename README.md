# tf-cats

A small project for a TensorFlow.js workshop.

Hold up one of my cats ("Oliver", the nice one, or "Rachel", the mean one) to the camera, and see if they're an angel or a demon. ðŸ˜¹

Obviously, this won't work with your cats (or your humans, for that matter), so you'll want to make your own model.
